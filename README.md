# Real Estate Web Application

## Project Overview

This project is a React-based web application for a real estate platform. It features a modern, responsive user interface with a login system and property listings. The project demonstrates the use of React, React Router for navigation, and Styled Components for styling.

## Key Features

- User authentication interface (frontend only at this stage)
- Property listings page
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- Modular component structure for easy maintenance and scalability

## Technologies Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- React Router: For handling navigation within the application
- Styled Components: For component-level styling with the added benefit of dynamic styling based on props

## Project Structure

The main components of the application are:

- `App.jsx`: The main component that sets up routing
- `Login.jsx`: Handles the user login interface
- `Imobi.jsx`: Displays property listings
- `Home.jsx`: The landing page of the application

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/teuzowebdeveloper9/imobiliaria
  ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   
3. Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```
4. Start the development server:
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```
5. Open your browser and visit 

## Future Development Plans

While the current version of the application is frontend-only, there are plans to develop a robust backend to support full functionality. The backend will likely be implemented using either:

- Laravel: A PHP web application framework known for its elegant syntax and powerful features
- Fastify: A high-performance Node.js web framework

The choice between these will depend on specific project requirements and performance considerations.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
